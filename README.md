# Microservice Patterns

Welcome to the Microservice Patterns repository! This repository contains a collection of popular microservice patterns that are commonly used in building scalable, reliable, and maintainable microservice-based applications. Following a monorepo architecture microservices built using [@jnxplus/nx-boot-gradle](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@jnxplus/nx-boot-gradle)

## Patterns

The following microservice patterns are included in this repository:

- **API Gateway Pattern**: A pattern that involves a centralized gateway that handles incoming requests and routes them to the appropriate microservices.
- **Circuit Breaker Pattern**: A pattern that helps prevent cascading failures in a microservice-based application by detecting and isolating failing services.
- **Event Sourcing Pattern**: A pattern that involves storing all changes to the state of a microservice as a sequence of events.
- **Service Registry Pattern**: A pattern that involves a central registry where microservices can register themselves and discover other services.
- **Saga Pattern**: A pattern that helps manage long-lived transactions in a distributed system by breaking them down into a series of smaller, compensatable transactions.
- **CQRS Pattern**: A pattern that separates the read and write operations of an application into different components, improving scalability and performance.

Each pattern in this repository includes a description, a diagram or code sample that illustrates how the pattern works, and links to additional resources for learning more about the pattern.
